# Fritzing Development Doxygen html

View this content on the [github page](https://mmerlin.github.io/fritzing-dev-doxygen/index.html) for this repository.

This is content generated from my fork and modifications to the source code in [the Fritzing application](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app). The script and configuration file used to generate the content are stored in, and part of the fritzing-app repository. They are not included in this repository.

Since my changes (so far at least) are small, and are intended to be merged back into the main fritzing-app repository, the content available here should fairly well reflect the state of the develop branch of [frtizing-app](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app), as of when it was [re]generated. With whatever changes I was working on, and interested in diagramming.

At the time of this writing, the configuration file and script used to build this content was sitting in a pull request, waiting to be merged into the core project. Once that is accepted, [variations of] the content here can be created (only on a linux system) by checking out that repo, installing doxygen, and running

```sh
path/to/fritzing-app/tools/build_doxygen.sh
```

The generated content is using the CC0 License, but the code segments included from the Fritzing application retain the GPL3 license from that repository.
